            Internships
          </h2>
          <p className="pt-8">
            At Aarna, we offer an internship experience that is enriching and
            challenging. We look for more than a strong academic record; we seek
            individuals who are motivated, eager to learn, and share the same
            values as the firm. We pride ourselves in the diversity of interns
            and the opportunities we’ve offered to students from all over the
            country. The internship period is 4-8 weeks. Interns have the
            opportunity to work with our disputes, insolvency law as well as our
            corporate advisory teams. During the internship period, the intern
            has a unique opportunity to get a practical insight into various
            aspects of our practice areas. Each intern is assigned a supervisor;
            however, they are expected to work with all teams in order to get a
            holistic experience. Our interns are expected to be aware of recent
            developments in the law in our practice areas. Each intern is
            assigned a topic to research on and at the end of the term, the
            intern is expected to make a presentation before the partners and
            all associates. We do not accept internship applications from
            students who are in the first and second year of the BA LLB (Hons.)
            programme and the 3 year LLB programme.
